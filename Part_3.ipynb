    "What to implement: A function `get_coocs(df, center_vocab, context_vocab)` which takes as input the DataFrame generated in step 1, and the lists generated in step 2 and returns a dictionary of dictionaries, of the form in the example above. It is up to you how you define context (full review? per sentence? a sliding window of fixed size?), and how to deal with exceptional cases (center words occurring more than once, center and context words being part of your vocabulary because they are frequent both as a noun and as a verb, etc). Use comments in your code to justify your approach. "

    "Local authorities in touristic hotspots like Amsterdam, NYC or Barcelona regulate the price of recreational apartments for rent to, among others, ensure that fair rent prices are kept for year-long residents. Consider your price recommender for hosts in Question 2c. Imagine that Airbnb recommends a new host to put the price of your flat at a price which is above the official regulations established by the local government. Upon inspection, you realize that the inflated price you have been recommended comes from many apartments in the area only being offered during an annual event which brings many tourists, and which causes prices to rise. \n",

    "In this context, critically reflect on the compliance of this recommender system with **one of the five actions** outlined in the **UK’s Data Ethics Framework**. You should prioritize the action that, in your opinion, is the weakest. Then, justify your choice by critically analyzing the three **key principles** outlined in the Framework, namely _transparency_, _accountability_ and _fairness_. Finally, you should propose and critically justify a solution that would improve the recommender system in at least one of these principles. You are strongly encouraged to follow a scholarly approach, e.g., with peer-reviewed references as support. \n",
