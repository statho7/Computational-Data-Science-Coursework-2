    "Local authorities in touristic hotspots like Amsterdam, NYC or Barcelona regulate the price of recreational apartments for rent to, among others, ensure that fair rent prices are kept for year-long residents. Consider your price recommender for hosts in Question 2c. Imagine that Airbnb recommends a new host to put the price of your flat at a price which is above the official regulations established by the local government. Upon inspection, you realize that the inflated price you have been recommended comes from many apartments in the area only being offered during an annual event which brings many tourists, and which causes prices to rise. \n",

    "The weakest action from the five outlined in the UK’s Data Ethics Framework is the “Review the quality and limitations of the data”. The bias of the prices for apartments only being offered during an annual event was not assessed and it creates false outputs and that has a negative effect to people. On the one hand the guests have a false opinion about prices as they are inflated by an event that occurs one time per year whilst this recommendation system is being used for the whole year by the guests. That means that they might select a room that is more expensive than it should be. On the other hand, the hosts that want to offer a new room may become too optimistic and set a price per night for their room that will mean guests will not choose and they will finally have a loss of income due to false information about the market status. As it is right now, we have a serious problem of Transparency to our data. It is not clear that we have a bias in our dataset that inflates prices and causes major problem to the people using our recommendation system. About the Accountability of our project there are also major concerns.  The challenge is big and it is described by Floridi and Taddeo in their journal “some crucial challenges include moral responsibility and accountability of both designers and data scientists with respect to unforeseen and undesired consequences as well as missed opportunities. Unsurprisingly, the ethical design and auditing of algorithms’ requirements and the assessment of potential, undesirable outcomes (e.g. discrimination or the promotion of antisocial content) is attracting increasing research.” [1]. We have not established any mechanism to combat biases against events price inflation or any other bias that could harm people or neighbourhoods. There is a chance that there might be a discrimination against some neighbourhoods, and they have lower price than they should. This statement also applies to the principle of Fairness. There has been no research as to if host that are people of colour for example tend to have lower prices to their apartments due to failures in our recommendation system to combat this discrimination. As stated by Markham 2018, “it is impossible to standardize or universalize what constitutes the ethically correct actions in technology design and research contexts, not least because we cannot predict what will happen as a result of our choices.”[2]. So, we have to implement a custom solution for our project that will assess biases and if possible, eliminate the discrimination against either guests or hosts. There has to be an extensive search on how the prices have been established at this level for each type of accommodation and for the neighbourhoods. Furthermore, we have to take into account the trends on the selection of an accommodation based on the profile of the guests but also the hosts. All these mechanism have to be transparent so everybody can understand the logic behind every decision the team that created this project made."
